# DevHelp

DevHelp is a open-source project, similar to medium, more precisely a clone of medium.

## Getting Started

To get the project setup on your local machine make sure to have node installed version 8 of above, and install dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

and this will install all the backend dependencies like express, mongoose, bcryptJS, config etc.., to setup the client side navigate to client folder and run the following command,

 ```
 npm install
 ```

### Prerequisites

All you need have installed is NodeJS on your local system

## Running the tests

Once the dependencies are installed you can run the project by navigation to root directory and run:

```
npm run dev
```

this will run both the Node Server and the client server simultaneously using a utility called concurrently.
